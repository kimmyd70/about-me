        <h1>Welcome to the About Me Guessing Game</h1>
        
        <!--bio, education (bulleted), job experience (bulleted), goals-->
        <p>My name is Kim Damalas.  My paternal grandfather immigrated from Thessaloniki 
            in northern Greece and settled in Chicago.  Our family is very proud of our Greek
            heritage.  Personally, I'd rather I'd not inherited the Greek nose!</p>

        <p>After graduating from college in 19-umm hmmm, I was commissioned an Officer in the Air Force 
            and ultimately stuck it out for 25 years. It was a great career that allowed me to travel the world
            and work with some amazing minds in technical fields such:
            <ul>
                <li> Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles</li>
                <li> Satellite Design and Operations</li>
                <li> Space-Object Tracking Radars</li>
                <li> National Missile Defense Systems</li>
                <li> Cybersecurity</li>
             </ul> 
        </p>
        
        <p> My last couple of positions were policy-oriented and very political, and I quickly decided it was time 
            for a change. I retired in early 2017 and started looking for a second career that would allow me to 
            work from home.  For the last two years, my job has been "student"--first in Graphic Design and now in 
            Software Development. I <strong>love</strong> learning! Not needing to pay for kids' college tuition, 
            I'm able to use my military education benefits for myself.
        </p>
        
        <p>I've been very fortunate to be formally educated in many areas--all paid for by the Air Force!</p>

        </ul>
